What is Django Custom Management Commands
------
> In Django project, We could manage by executing some commands which could be invoked through the manage.py. 

> Management Command is used to create our own actions with manage.py. If your app is in projectdirectory then create the directories.

Example
------
In this example, we are going to *create* 10 different users using Django user API via management command (**createusers**).
`python manage.py createusers`

Steps for creating Django Custom Management Commands
------
        django-admin startproject django_management_commands 
        cd django_management_commands
        python manage.py startapp webapp
        python manage.py migrate

**So final project directory structure should be-**
```YAML
django_management_commands
   webapp/
      __init__.py
      models.py
      management/
         __init__.py      
         commands/
            __init__.py
            createusers.py
      tests.py
      views.py
```

createusers.py
---------
```python
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand, CommandError
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Command for creating 10 superusers'

    # def add_arguments(self, parser):
    #     parser.add_argument('poll_ids', nargs='+', type=int)

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        User.objects.all().delete()
        for i in range(1,10):
            User.objects.create_superuser(username='superuser'+str(i),password='superuser',email='superuser'+str(i)+'@gmail.com').save()
        return "Successfully create "+str(len(User.objects.all()))+" superusers"
```
Steps for running Django Custom Management Commands
------
`python manage.py createusers`

By using above command, it will use django default users api for creating 10 different users and we can access admin UI console using credentials like username: superuser1/2/3/4 and password: superuser

`Note: Above django project prepared and tested on django==2.2.3 and djangorestframework==3.10.2`
